## Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This Squared project makes use of ADR's to record architectural decisions roughly as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). 
In a nutshell, these are used to document architectural decisions and to provide a record of the decisions made by the team and contributors in regard to the Squared project's architecture. These are held in [docs/adr](https://gitlab.com/meltano/squared/-/tree/master/docs/adr). 
To propose or add a new ADR, its simplest to create a new entry using [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools), and then send a long a merge request for review.

```bash
brew install adr-tools
adr new <My ADR Name>
```
