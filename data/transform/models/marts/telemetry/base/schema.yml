models:
  - name: structured_executions
    description: This table includes the blended set of structured legacy Google Analytics (GA) and Snowplow data.
      Projects are compared using event counts at the week level, once they have parity for a week we switch to using Snowplow over GA.
      There are data tests that assert that the project and event counts in this table are >= that of just GA.
