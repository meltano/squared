models:
  - name: execution_mapping
    description: This table maps every event_id to an execution_id and project_id. These attributes
      are nested a particular context in the contexts field so they need to be parsed out to allow us
      to join all events in the same execution together.
    columns:
      - name: event_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: execution_id
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: project_id
        tests:
          - not_null

  - name: unstruct_plugins_base
    description: This table contains unique plugins details sourced from the unstructured event data.
      This data is still in its hashed form. The set attributes for the plugin (i.e. name_hash, variant_name_hash, etc.)
      are hashed to define a unique plugin_surrogate_key for each plugin.
    columns:
      - name: plugin_surrogate_key
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

  - name: unstruct_plugins
    description: This table contains unique plugins details sourced from the unstructured event data. The plugin
      hashed metadata has been attempted to be unhashed and some grouping is done to group things like Singer and dbt.
    columns:
      - name: plugin_surrogate_key
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

  - name: unstruct_exec_flattened
    description: This table includes the unstructured Snowplow data rolled up to the execution level. Additionally, structured Snowplow data
      is also included when it has unstructured contexts attached to it. This is because many events can fire for a single execution so the
      unstructured contexts have been unnested to retrieve keys by name depending on the context, then renested to roll up to the CLI execution level.
      The rows in this table represent a flattened CLI execution, not each individual event.
    columns:
      - name: execution_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
      - name: started_ts
