# This gitignore was auto-generated by the Meltano airflow extension.
# It will ignore everything in $AIRFLOW_HOME but airflow.cfg and
# webserver_config.py by default. You can adjust this to your needs,
# but be careful not to commit sensitive data to your repository.

# Allow this gitignore, airflow.cfg, webserver_config.py to be checked in to the repo.
